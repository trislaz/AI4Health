# Tutorial notebooks - AI4Health Summer School

> ðŸ‘€â€‹ How to use these notebooks ?
> Go through the notebooks cells by cells, they are not independant and you will need previous cells to run the later ones.
> Many questions are scattered throughout the notebooks. Questions in the first notebook are interesting to get used to WSI manipulation, 
> questions in the second may be a bit broader and open: you are free to solve these questions yourself (what I would advise) or to just copy the answers present in the `answers.py` file.
> Open questions will be adressed orally. Alternatively, you may find the full corrected notebook in the first commit of this repo.

You should now have an `./assets` subfolder.
